# Printf Project in C

This project implements a custom version of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The `printf` function is a standard library function that allows you to format and print output to the console. Our implementation aims to provide similar functionality while also offering some additional features.

## Introduction

The `printf` function is a crucial part of C programming, used to display formatted output. Our project reimagines this functionality, offering flexibility and customization beyond what the standard `printf` function provides. We have designed it to be user-friendly and easy to integrate into existing C projects.

## Features

- **Custom Formatting:** Our implementation supports various format specifiers, allowing you to control the formatting of different data types, such as integers, strings, characters, and more.

- **Width and Precision:** You can specify the width and precision of the output, controlling the number of characters printed and the number of decimal places displayed for floating-point numbers.

- **Colorful Output:** Add a touch of style to your console output by printing text in different colors. This feature is particularly useful for highlighting important information.

- **Dynamic Memory:** Our implementation efficiently manages memory, ensuring minimal memory leaks and optimal performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Esodi/printf.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd printf`
3. Include the `printf.h` header file in your C code: `#include "printf.h"`
4. Compile your code, linking it with `printf.c`: `gcc your_code.c printf.c -o output`

## Format Specifiers

Our custom `printf` implementation supports the following format specifiers:

- `%d` or `%i`: Print integers.
- `%f`: Print floating-point numbers.
- `%c`: Print characters.
- `%s`: Print strings.
- `%x` or `%X`: Print integers in hexadecimal format.
- `%o`: Print integers in octal format.

## Examples
